## üåü Overview

This project is a professional portfolio specifically developed for my application to the Product Manager position at EZ-AD. It was created in less than 2 hours using Windsurf as an AI development assistant, demonstrating both technical competencies and the value of a hands-on approach to product management.

The site highlights my experience in Product Management with a focus on tangible metrics and measurable results. The portfolio is optimized to offer an excellent user experience and high performance on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üíª Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/brunosard/ezad-tpm-application.git
cd ezad-tpm-application

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the project in development environment.

## üèóÔ∏è Build Process

This project uses an optimized build process for static export, including a custom solution to solve common CSS and JavaScript relative path issues:

```bash
# Complete build with automatic path correction
npm run build
```

The above command generates the production version in the `out/` folder and automatically runs the `fix-paths.js` script to ensure compatibility with static hosting.

### Additional Commands

```bash
# Build only without path correction
npm run build:local

# Apply path correction separately
npm run fix-paths

# Serve the production version locally
npm run serve
```

## üîÑ CI/CD

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows configured to:

1. Build the project automatically when there is a push to the master branch
2. Run the path correction script
3. Deploy via SFTP to the hosting server

To configure deployment, you need to add the following secrets to the GitHub repository:
- `SFTP_SERVER`: SFTP server address
- `SFTP_USERNAME`: username
- `SFTP_PASSWORD`: password
- `SFTP_PORT`: port (usually 22)
- `SFTP_SERVER_DIR`: target directory on the server

## üß† Technical Solutions

### Static Export

The project was configured with `output: 'export'` in `next.config.ts` to generate static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be hosted on any server.

### Relative Path Correction

The custom `fix-paths.js` script automatically modifies absolute paths to relative paths in all generated HTML files, ensuring resources are loaded correctly in various hosting environments.

### Server Configuration

The project includes `.htaccess` and `.nojekyll` files to optimize compatibility with different hosting environments.
